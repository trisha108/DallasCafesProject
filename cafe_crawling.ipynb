As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with what looks like an incomplete shop that is bare and looks like a work in progress. The staff fo their job but dont feel very welcoming. Their food selection is terrible and not at all appetizing. Their matcha that people on social media raves about are super mediocre, and priced higher than what it should be for what you get. I drove 45 min with high expectations only to be severely let down on all fronts. There's nothing special or noteworthy about this place that deserves more than average ratings.   \n",

The lattes were tasty. The service was friendly. We came here to do some remote work, but it was packed so a little hard to find enough space. It’s a good sign when a place is very busy although it can get a bit loud when you’re trying to work. I’d recommend that they get a larger food menu for breakfast, because we were limited to avocado toast or a pastry. The toast was okay but not very filling.   \n",
       "1520  Escape 360 in McKinney is definitely worth a visit! The place is spacious and modern, even though it gets pretty crowded—especially on weekends. The food was delicious and fresh, and while the prices are a bit higher than some other spots, the quality makes up for it.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the overall vibe, but one downside was the 18% service fee added to the bill. Also, having to scan a QR code to order from your phone felt a little impersonal, especially since dine-in customers are expected to order that way. I was told the counter ordering is only for to-go orders, which was a bit confusing.\\n\\nStill, if you're looking for a trendy and tasty spot in McKinney, this is a great choice. Just be prepared for the tech-based ordering!   \n",

I would really have liked to have a minute or so to look at what they had to offer to eat, but I must have looked like one of those people who wanted to take advantage of their bathroom for who knows what.

I told him “could i have a venti hot pumpkin latte” he said “okay you said a latte right? hot or iced” i told him hot even though i had already said it. I totally get it. i used to work at a coffee shop and those headsets are totally hard to hear through. After, my boyfriend ordered his drink and the man over the microphone said “you’re gonna have to let the driver talk dude i can’t hear nothing.” i thought that was a kind of unprofessional way to say something but again, i was like whatever because i get that they were busy and i don’t expect perfect customer service to the places i go to. however, i again said i would like a grande iced white mocha latte. I heard the person in the microphone laughing at something and then he stated “okay do you want that hot or iced” and at that point i got a little annoyed because he wasn’t listening at all so i looked at my boyfriend and raised my hand in the air like “really?” but i was still polite when i spoke to the worker. well we got to the window and this young girl handed us our order and we checked out. she was very polite. while she was getting our last drink, an asian man came to the window and just stood there and kept looking over at us. when she handed him our last drink, he handed it to us and said “you know bro i can see you in the drive through and you don’t need to catch an attitude like that. have a nice day.” I was infuriated because i was very polite to him through the microphone even though he was not listening to us. i said back to him “we didn’t catch an attitude you’re the one that’s upset right now.” and he said “yes you did now go and have a good day.” So we left and decided to call to put in a complaint with the manager. we called the store and a young lady answered and was very kind. she handed the phone to the manager and i told him that i needed to put in a complaint. I said “hi i’m not sure who it was that took our order a second ago but i just wanted to let you know that he was really rude.” Turns out it was the same guy that took our order that was the manager (whether he really is or not who knows. i can’t imagine someone that trashy would make their way to managing a starbucks). He then accused me of saying the f-word which i understand he could have misunderstood what i said and heard that. Anyway, he stated that we don’t need to have an attitude with him because “he didn’t do anything wrong.” I again told him we didn’t have an attitude. he then began to argue with us. So we asked for his name and he said his name was mike. my boyfriend then asked mike who? and he said “mike lowery” which is the name of a character in a movie or show (not really sure but i’ve also heard it in a song before.) i then told my boyfriend that’s not a real name and to not even bother with trying to get it. i then said that he was very unprofessional and he started cussing at us and stated “i have your member id from when you scanned your app so don’t mess with me.” He then hung up. I have never had an experience like that at any restaurant before and i will not be returning ever to this location. I don’t want to associate with someone that is so unprofessional and trashy. We did report him to the corporate number and gave a description of him and they refunded our money. however, that is still not enough to ever make me go back to that location. i pray that no one has to come into contact with him again at that starbucks because you will feel like you just got done speaking with a brick wall when you leave. this starbucks was convenient because it was so close to where i live but id rather pay 20$ for a coffee if i had to and go somewhere else then go back to that starbucks.</td>\n",

It was basically just coffee with barely any milk foam — definitely not what a cappuccino should be. On top of that, the cup didn’t have the heat-protective sleeve, so it was burning hot to hold. Very disappointing experience at Starbucks today.   \n",

I was surprised to see “Happy Birthday” on my cup. I was such a small gesture but it make me feel extra special and made my day! Thank you for the thoughtfull gesture!   \n",

I saw there were locks on the doors, so I told the cashier I was going to get something to eat and drink but I really needed to get into the restroom. But, no, I had to order first. So I quickly chose a coffee and something to eat, and then she condescended to give me the combination to the restroom. I would really have liked to have a minute or so to look at what they had to offer to eat, but I must have looked like one of those people who wanted to take advantage of their bathroom for who knows what. Apparently there is no room in their silly policy, or in that cashier, for mercy.   \n",

The owner or manager who is always there is literally what makes this location great as to previous experiences before he was there! He is kind and attentive. I typically visit with both of my dogs while we are on a walk and he ALWAYS lets the 3 of us in without any issues so we can retrieve our drinks. Always offering a pup cup which we gladly take each time. The drinks are always delicious as they have always been but the way he treats and cares for customers is what makes this location a staple in the oaklawn community. Thank you!   \n",

Friendly baristas with a positive attitude. I like that there is often some drink samples to try! Although the food variety is not always too big.   \n",

Yes, my order is odd but it is very simple. I go to Starbucks various locations all the time to get this though this was my first time at this location. Espe was so rude she even refused to do it. Completely shut me down and said no even though I tried to tell her what it was and that I’ve gotten it at every starbucks from other ones in Dallas to some in Arizona. She ruined my experience of this location. Also my drink was 3/4 full! This location is not the one to go to.   \n",
       "17  I usually don’t leave many reviews but i had to after my experience today. I went through this location this afternoon and i have never been so disappointed with the service from a business in my entire life. when i got to the microphone, a man answered and took my order. I told him “could i have a venti hot pumpkin latte” he said “okay you said a latte right? hot or iced” i told him hot even though i had already said it. I totally get it. i used to work at a coffee shop and those headsets are totally hard to hear through. After, my boyfriend ordered his drink and the man over the microphone said “you’re gonna have to let the driver talk dude i can’t hear nothing.” i thought that was a kind of unprofessional way to say something but again, i was like whatever because i get that they were busy and i don’t expect perfect customer service to the places i go to. however, i again said i would like a grande iced white mocha latte. I heard the person in the microphone laughing at something and then he stated “okay do you want that hot or iced” and at that point i got a little annoyed because he wasn’t listening at all so i looked at my boyfriend and raised my hand in the air like “really?” but i was still polite when i spoke to the worker. well we got to the window and this young girl handed us our order and we checked out. she was very polite. while she was getting our last drink, an asian man came to the window and just stood there and kept looking over at us. when she handed him our last drink, he handed it to us and said “you know bro i can see you in the drive through and you don’t need to catch an attitude like that. have a nice day.” I was infuriated because i was very polite to him through the microphone even though he was not listening to us. i said back to him “we didn’t catch an attitude you’re the one that’s upset right now.” and he said “yes you did now go and have a good day.” So we left and decided to call to put in a complaint with the manager. we called the store and a young lady answered and was very kind. she handed the phone to the manager and i told him that i needed to put in a complaint. I said “hi i’m not sure who it was that took our order a second ago but i just wanted to let you know that he was really rude.” Turns out it was the same guy that took our order that was the manager (whether he really is or not who knows. i can’t imagine someone that trashy would make their way to managing a starbucks). He then accused me of saying the f-word which i understand he could have misunderstood what i said and heard that. Anyway, he stated that we don’t need to have an attitude with him because “he didn’t do anything wrong.” I again told him we didn’t have an attitude. he then began to argue with us. So we asked for his name and he said his name was mike. my boyfriend then asked mike who? and he said “mike lowery” which is the name of a character in a movie or show (not really sure but i’ve also heard it in a song before.) i then told my boyfriend that’s not a real name and to not even bother with trying to get it. i then said that he was very unprofessional and he started cussing at us and stated “i have your member id from when you scanned your app so don’t mess with me.” He then hung up. I have never had an experience like that at any restaurant before and i will not be returning ever to this location. I don’t want to associate with someone that is so unprofessional and trashy. We did report him to the corporate number and gave a description of him and they refunded our money. however, that is still not enough to ever make me go back to that location. i pray that no one has to come into contact with him again at that starbucks because you will feel like you just got done speaking with a brick wall when you leave. this starbucks was convenient because it was so close to where i live but id rather pay 20$ for a coffee if i had to and go somewhere else then go back to that starbucks.   \n",

The sugar plum Danish was given to me COLD. The lady at the register told me I would have to wait out of the drive thru if I wanted it \"re-warmed\". That thing was almost frozen, therefore no it wasn't warmed before I got to the window. Very disappointing.   \n",

When I told her she made a face and visibly frustrated. She told me to park and she would bring it to me. Problem is she gave the wrong size. You need to put your best people at the drive thru. Nit sure if she's having a bad day but I just paid for something didn't order and she caught a little attitude.   \n",

I love it because the service is superb. Every person in the drive-through is friendly and you can hear their smile through the drive-through speaker. However, A proper analysis of the service area was not shared with the team that created the layout. (Poorly engineered). It’s hideous.  The people coming out of drive-through are often blocked by the people in line for the drive-through. The cars in line for the drive-through are also blocking any parking spaces that are available at this location.   \n",

      "804   OKKKKK—what a 💎 GEM💎 of a place!!! Walking in, I am greeted with both a “Welcome” and refreshing AC.\\nFirst thing I try is the yummy Chicken Salad Wrap. 5 pieces for $5.99… in this economy? Awesome. 😎 (Halal, and also made in house) They have a points reward system that is very easy to sign up for, and they offer a student discount. Easy access to an outlet for my laptop. Many tables inside and out. Lounge chairs.\\nThe young man who helped me (had glasses on) was so kind to me. I was able to try their basbousa. (sweet, perfect textured, cakey dessert) I also had their D-Stachio Latte… Im impressed…& I used to be a barista/manager at a cafe/coffee house. I *think* they also sell their coffee beans. Everything here from service to seating to atmosphere to food to friendliness of the staff, is clearly done with intention, effort, & pride. The hours are perfect for anyone looking for breakfast early in the morning or a late night snack, hang out, study spot. Glad that I was nearby and walked in. 🙂   \n",
      "838                                    Note: Reviewing as a coffee shop, not live music venue. If coming for coffee shop, note that during live music events there is sometimes a charge (not sure if it’s every time, but when I was there it was $15 to stay once the live music started, I wasn’t there for the show, so I had to leave).\\n\\nI love the ambience and decor style here and the drink menu has a lot of options. Comfortable seating options for relaxing, reading, studying, hanging out. I like that they stay open late, although I was bummed when I had to either pay a cover charge or leave once the live music started (I had arrived before that and ordered my drink without being told that I’d have to pay or leave shortly, so I was already seated with my drink and book and all, and then when the music started someone came and said I either needed to pay for the music or leave).\\n\\nOne reason I like the location is that it’s easy walking distance from the DART station (Cedars station, red & blue lines).   \n",

They are open till 4 am for Ramadan. The servers were so welcoming despite it being past midnight.  ✨\\n\\nWhat we ordered 🍽️: Syrian makdus, Saffron rice bowl with Shish, Lebenese Shish  Tawooq tacos, Special BBQ wings, Kunafeh cheesecake, Signature Waffle.\\n\\nI personally loved the Shish Chicken. It was succulent, juicy and flavorful. 🍗\\nAlso, the Syrian makdus toast was tangy and spicy. Another dish I highly recommend. Loved the flavour profile that olives added to the the toast. 🥪\\n\\nThey were extremely kind and also gave us an Oreo/chocolate milk cake on the house. 🍰It was so soft and decadent.\\n\\nLoved our visit and will come back to try the rest of the menu too!!! 😍   \n",

It’s a cozy and beautiful place, perfect for catching up with friends or just enjoying some quiet time alone. They offer a wide variety of coffee, tea, specialty drinks, and desserts — there’s truly something for everyone. I loved how thoughtfully designed the space is, with both gorgeous indoor and outdoor seating areas that feel inviting and relaxed. They also have a cute photo area that’s great for snapping some fun memories. Another huge plus — it’s one of the few places that stays open late, all the way till midnight! Whether you’re craving a late-night coffee or just looking for a cozy spot to unwind after dinner, Escape 360 is the perfect choice. The atmosphere, drinks, and desserts all exceeded my expectations. Definitely a must-visit if you’re in the area.   \n",

They have a huge selection of pastries, cakes, and drinks. We bought a birthday cake here and could’ve not have been more satisfied. The cake box was wrapped with a bow, included a happy birthday sign, cake cutter, and candles. The cake tasted amazing!! We got the midnight lady and yummy yummy!! 🤤 Will definitely be back again. 💯   \n",

Open until 10pm, super kind owners and staff, comfortable atmosphere with lots of seating, and phenomenal drinks! I had the lavender honey latte, and my friend had the pistachio latte. We also had the tiramisu. It was light and fluffy and not too sweet. Would recommend all 100%! We will definitely be back!   \n",
